# How do I play with this repo?

You need tree-sitter CLI, either from npm or cargo  
`cargo install tree-sitter-cli`

Then you need to navigate to the root directory of this repo and create your parser with  
`tree-sitter generate`

and now we can test it on the example file with  
`tree-sitter parse example-file`
